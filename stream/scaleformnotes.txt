Open atm.gfx in FFDEC (JPEXS)
Sprites are pages
I have  begun creating a new page (transferMC)
Only added the background so far, but it WORKS!
Functions are controlled in scripts/__Packages/com/rockstargames/gtav/levelDesign/ATM

is input even possible? i think not
IT IS! look at dock tease yacht naming

game plan:
copy shapes
	edit for atm?
put into atm
profit?

things to consider-
only transfer to online players? yes
if not, static routing number?
do we give a list of online players?
???????????
